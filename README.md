Welcome to the Simon Game project! This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can access the live version of the game [here.](https://yash7704.github.io/Simon-Game/)


## Description

Simon is a memory game where players need to replicate a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The game starts with a single color/sound, and with each successful sequence repetition, an additional color/sound is added to the pattern.


## Gameplay



- Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
- The game will display the current level at the top.
- The game will generate a random color and sound sequence, adding one additional step with each level.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons.
- If you click the correct colors in the correct order, you will advance to the next level.
- If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.
